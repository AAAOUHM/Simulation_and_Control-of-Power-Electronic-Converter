# power_electronic_converters_modelling and simulation
We have done the component sizing and  open loop simulation of various commonly used:
1) dc dc converters:(buck, boost,buck_boost,sepic and flyback) 
2) inverters:(single phase vsi(bipolar and unipolar spwm),3 phase full bridge voltage source inverters(by unipolar spwm) ) and
3) rectifiers(single phase and 3 phase controlled rectifiers).
4)dual active bridge converter
5)resonant llc converter
A full lab report is present. Inside each folder the problem or design requirement is given. 1st run the matlab file and then run the simulink model to see the simulations. 
also we have done pid control and type 2 compensator design for some converters.
