# power_electronic_converters_modelling, control and simulation
We have done the component sizing and  open loop and clolsed loop simulation of various commonly used:
1) inverters:(single phase vsi(bipolar and unipolar spwm),3 phase full bridge voltage source inverters(by unipolar spwm) )
2)  dc dc converters:(buck, boost,buck_boost,sepic and flyback) 
3) rectifiers(single phase and 3 phase controlled rectifiers).
4) non isolated bidirectional converter for cc_cv battery charging
5) resonant llc converter
6) phase shifted full bridge converter
7) A full lab report is present. Inside each folder the problem or design requirement is given.
1st run the matlab file and then run the simulink model to see the simulations. 
also we have done pid control and type 2 compensator design for some converters.
